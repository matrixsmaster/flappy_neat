<General>
This program represents a testbench for neuro-evolution algorithms and reinforcement learning.
It implements both classic methods and operators as well as introducing new and unique operators. One example of a new and unique genetic operator is "Alpha-selection".
***
Elite
This parameter controls the amount of most top-performing actors to be copied verbatim to the next generation.
***
Alpha
This parameter controls the amount of unique top-performing actors (Elite actors included in this pool) to be mated with a unique corresponding group of Beta actors.
***
Beta
This parameter defines the size of a group to be mated per each Alpha actor. Beta actors are selected after all Alpha actors have been identified and represent second-best actors after all Alpha actors.
***
Omega
This value represents the remaining of the population to be considered for crossovers after all Alpha and Beta actors were selected. Passive parameter.
***
Random fill
This value represents the remaining of the next generation population which can't be formed by crossovers, and have to be filled with random genes. This usually is either 1 or 0 (depending on the even/odd size of the population and even/odd amount of Elite actors).
