# üê§ Flappy NEAT

<img src="img/screenshot01.jpg" alt="screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;" />

**Flappy NEAT** is a chaotic little testbench where neural networks learn to play a Flappy Bird‚Äìstyle game using a mix of **genetic neuro-evolution** and **reinforcement learning**. It‚Äôs designed to let you:

- Compare **human**, **algorithmic**, **neuro-evolved**, and **RL-trained** performance
- Seamlessly switch from **evolution** to **RL fine-tuning** once a score threshold is hit
- Experiment with unique genetic operators and learning tricks you've probably never seen before

It‚Äôs a research toy, a performance benchmark, and a testbed for weird ideas‚Äîall in one.

## üß† Highlights

- üöÄ **Alpha-selection**: A novel genetic operator to drive better diversity
- üî• **Neuron heat dynamics**: RL weight updates are modulated by how ‚Äúhot‚Äù neurons are
- üß¨ **Custom crossover/inversion/mutation logic**
- üé© **Interactive human mode** for score comparison
- ü§ñ **Algorithmic solver mode** (perfect agent)
- üß™ **Experimental PPO-inspired RL strategy**
- üîÄ **Hybrid GA ‚Üí RL transition** based on fitness threshold
- üõ†Ô∏è **Live UI** with parameter tweaking
- üìö **Help system** built into the UI with all information needed to understand every parameter
- üîÑ **Save/load for agents and populations**
- üåç **Neural network visualization and weight matrix viewer**
- üïõ **Scenario replay support for post-mortem analysis**

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project

### A precompiled `.exe` is provided with each release - you can run it directly in windows or WINE.

This program was built using **Delphi 7**, which means:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You will need a **Windows XP environment** with **Delphi 7** installed to compile and run this project.

We recommend spinning up a virtual machine for this purpose. Nostalgia points are included for free.

## üß™ Sample Use Case

Train a population to solve the level using evolution, then transition into RL for fine-tuning behavior. Compare its score to your own flapping skills, or the perfect algorithmic solver. Discover if your `AlphaSort` operator beats standard crossover methods. Watch neuron "heat maps" influence updates. Or just... create a mutant bird that flaps with pure chaos.

Hint: Try to use test INI files provided in the repo.
